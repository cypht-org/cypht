## Gmail contacts

This module set provides read-only access to Gmail contacts associated
with any Gmail account setup in Cypht. Gmail accounts must be enabled
using the "add new account" feature of the nux module set and must use
the Oauth2 authentication methods, since that is the only way we can
access the contacts API.
