; The dynamic login module set tries to autodetect mail server configurations,
; but you can configure it to act specifically with the following settings.
;
; Set this to true to use the hostname in the URL used to access Cypht to
; determine the domain for mail services (IMAP/SMTP). If this is set to
; true, the mail service selection dropdown is not displayed on the login page.
dynamic_host=true

; If dynamic_host is true, you can strip the subdomain on the url with this
; setting. Leave empty for no subdomain. For example, if a user accesses Cypht
; at webmail.example.com, set this to "webmail" to use just example.com for the
; IMAP/SMTP services.
dynamic_host_subdomain=""

; Set this to true to use the domain portion of an E-mail address used as a
; username during login for mail services. Even if this is set to false, it
; will still by attempted if dynamic_host is disabled and "other" is selected
; from the mail service dropdown. If set to true, the mail service selection
; dropdown is not displayed on the login page.
dynamic_user=false

; Subdomain to prepend to the mail service domain for SMTP. If the mail service
; domain is example.com, but the SMTP server is at smtp.example.com, you would
; set this to "smtp". Leave blank for no subdomain.
dynamic_smtp_subdomain=""

; Subdomain to prepend to the mail service domain for IMAP. If the mail
; service is example.com, but the IMAP service is at "mail", you would
; set this to "mail". Leave blank for no subdomain.
dynamic_mail_subdomain=""
