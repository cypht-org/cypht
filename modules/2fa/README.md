## 2FA

This module set provides the ability for users to enable "two factor
authentication" (2fa), requiring a user to enter a one time code from an
authentication app (like Google Authenticator). It uses the TOTP protocol and
provides a QR code image in the settings page to make it easy to setup in
authentication apps. It also provides backup code support in case of account
lock out.
