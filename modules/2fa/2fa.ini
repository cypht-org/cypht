; Enter the raw secret value (minimum 10 characters) to be used with the Google
; Authenticator Application (or any TOTP app providing 6 digit pins). Users
; must opt-in for 2fa on the site settings page which provides a QR barcode
; to configure Google Authenticator.
;
; In order for 2fa to work, your server MUST have an accurate date and time,
; otherwise the codes won't match up. NTP is the standard way to keep a server's
; time synced: http://www.ntp.org/

2fa_secret=""

; By default the generated secret will be 64 characters before being base32
; encoded. To use a shorter secret that is easier to manually enter, set the
; following to true. Note that if you change this setting after users have
; enabled 2fa, they will have to use a backup code to login, then reset there
; account in the authenticator app.
