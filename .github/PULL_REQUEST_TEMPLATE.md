Validate your PR title - a quick Guide

A valid PR title contains a type (https://github.com/commitizen/conventional-commit-types/blob/master/index.json), a scope (https://github.com/cypht-org/cypht/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.lint.pr.yml#L31) and a title starting with a lower case letter.

Here are some valid examples:
- fix(frontend): my fix
- feat(backend): my feature
- docs(docker): my docs
- refactor(frontend/backend) : my refactor
- test(unit): my test
