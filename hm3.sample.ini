; General settings
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; Session Type
; ------------
; Sessions are how the server maintains your logged in state. Cypht supports
; standard PHP sessions, as well as its own completely independent session
; system that uses memcached or a database for storage. In order to use
; database sessions, the database must be correctly configured in the "DB
; Support" section and the hm_user_session table must be created. In order to
; use Memcached sessions, the memcached server must be correctly configured
; in the "Memcached Support" section. In order to use Redis session, the
; Redis server must be configured in the "Redis Support" section.
;
; Valid values for this setting:
;
;  PHP     Standard PHP session handlers
;  DB      Custom database based sessions
;  MEM     Custom Memcached based sessions
;  REDIS   Custom Redis based sessions
;  custom  Create your own session class. See the modules/site/lib.php file for
;          more info
;
session_type=PHP


; Authentication Type
; -------------------
; This setting defines how Cypht will authenticate your username and password
; when you login. If you want to use a database it must be correctly configured
; in the "DB Support" section and the hm_user table must be created. There are
; 3 PHP cli scripts to help manage database users in the scripts/ directory (
; create_account.php, delete_account.php, and update_password.php). If you want
; to authenticate against an IMAP server, you must setup the imap_auth_* settings
; below. If you want to authenticate against an LDAP server,
; you must setup the ldap_auth_* settings. Finally, if you want to let users
; pick from a list of popular mail services or try to auto-discover a mail
; system, set this to dynamic and make sure the dynamic_login module set is
; enabled in the "Module Sets" section of this file.
; 
; Valid values for this setting:
;
;  DB       Authenticate against the database
;  LDAP     Authenticate against an LDAP server
;  IMAP     Authenticate using an IMAP server
;  dynamic  Let the user choose from a list, or try to auto discover the mail
;           services based on the email domain
;  custom   Create your own auth class. See the modules/site/lib.php file for
;           more info
;
auth_type=DB


; LDAP Authentication
; -------------------
; If auth_type is set to LDAP, configure the LDAP server to authenticate against
; with the following settings, otherwise these are ignored.
;

; The hostname or IP address of the LDAP server to authenticate to
ldap_auth_server=localhost

; The port the LDAP server is listening on.
ldap_auth_port=389

; Enable TLS/SSL connections. Leave blank or set to false to disable. Set to
; true to enable TLS connections.
ldap_auth_tls=

; The "base dn" of the LDAP server
ldap_auth_base_dn="example,dc=com"


; IMAP Authentication
; -------------------
; If auth_type is set to IMAP, configure the IMAP server to authenticate against
; with the following settings, otherwise these are ignored.
;
; This is just a label used in the UI. It can be set to anything
imap_auth_name=localhost

; The hostname or IP address of the IMAP server to authenticate to
imap_auth_server=localhost

; The port the IMAP server is listening on.
imap_auth_port=143

; Enable TLS/SSL connections. Leave blank or set to false to disable. Set to
; true to enable TLS connections. If you want to use IMAP STARTTLS, do NOT
; enable this. This is only for TLS enabled sockets (typically on port 993).
imap_auth_tls=

; The hostname/IP address and port sieve is listening on. Example: example.org:4190
; Note: Add tls:// prefix to enable explicit STARTTLS
imap_auth_sieve_conf_host=


; Default SMTP Server
; -------------------
; You can set a default SMTP server for all Cypht users. Authentication will be
; done with the users login credentials, so this only makes sense if you are
; using IMAP for authentication. Leave these values blank to disable a
; default SMTP server, otherwise fill in the required values below
;
; This is just a label used in the UI. It can be set to anything
default_smtp_name=

; The hostname or IP address of the SMTP server
default_smtp_server=

; The port the SMTP server is listening on.
default_smtp_port=

; Enable TLS/SSL connections. Leave blank or set to false to disable. Set to
; true to enable TLS connections.
default_smtp_tls=

; If your SMTP service does not require authentication, you can disable it
; by setting the following to true.
default_smtp_no_auth=


; Settings Storage
; ----------------
; Cypht supports 3 methods for saving user settings between logins. File based
; settings, database table or custom implementation. To store settings in a
; database, it must be configured in the "DB Support" section and the
; hm_user_settings table must be created. To store settings on the filesystem,
; the user_settings_dir must be created and the webserver software must be able
; to write to it. For custom implementations, see Hm_User_Config_File.
; 
; Valid values for this setting:
;
;  file    Store user settings in the filesystem
;  DB      Store user settings in a database
;  custom  Store user settings via custom implementation. Specify class name
;          after colon, e.g. custom:Custom_User_Config
;
user_config_type=file


; Settings Location
; -----------------
; If user_config_type is set to file, this must be set to an existing directory
; that the webserver software can read and write to. If settings storage is set
; to DB, this is ignored. It should not be inside the webserver document root.
user_settings_dir=/var/lib/hm3/users


; Attachment Location
; -------------------
; Cypht needs a temporary place to store attachments that are to be sent with
; an outgoing message. This folder must exist and be writable by the webserver
; software. It should not be inside the webserver document root.
attachment_dir=/var/lib/hm3/attachments


; Application Data Location
; -------------------------
; Some Cypht module sets have their own ini files that need to be readable by
; the webserver software, but not writable, and definitely not inside the
; webserver document root.
app_data_dir=/var/lib/hm3/app_data


; Disable origin check
; --------------------
; To help protect against CSRF attacks, Cypht checks origin headers to confirm
; that the source and target origin domains match. If you are using proxies this
; could create a problem making it impossible to login. Change this to true to
; disable the origin check.
disable_origin_check=false


; Admin Users
; ----------
; You can define a comma delimited list of admin users that Cypht will grant
; special rights to. Currently this only enables the "create account" link in
; the account module set that provides a form to create a new account. This is
; only used if the auth_type is set to DB. Leave this blank if you don't want
; to define any admin users, or are using IMAP authentication.
admin_users=


; Cookie Domain
; -------------
; By default Cypht uses the server name used in the request to determine
; the domain name to set the cookie for. Configurations that use a reverse
; proxy might need to define the domain name used for cookies. Leave this
; blank to let Cypht automatically determine the domain. You can also use
; the special value of "none" to force Cypht to NOT set the cookie domain
; property at all. This is not recommended unless you know what you are
; doing!
cookie_domain=


; Cookie Path
; -------------
; By default Cypht uses the request URI to determine the cookie path to set
; the cookie for. Configurations that use mod_rewrite might need to define
; the path used for cookies. E.g. /cypht/embedded?page=compose will set path
; to /cypht/embedded/ which won't send the cookies back to the server. In that
; case set cookie_path=/cypht/. Leave this blank to let Cypht automatically
; determine the path. You can also use the special value of "none" to force
; Cypht to NOT set the cookie path property at all. This is not recommended
; unless you know what you are doing!
cookie_path=


; Outbound Email Domain
; ----------------------
; Default domain used for outbound email addresses when using IMAP auth and
; users don't login with a full email address. Users can customize this with
; the profiles module which will override this default
default_email_domain=


; Auto-Create Profile
; -------------------
; When a user logs in and they have only 1 IMAP server and 1 SMTP server, and
; no configured profiles - enabling this option will auto-create a profile for
; them. Email and reply-to addresses will use the default_email_domain if
; set, otherwise it will fallback to the domain Cypht is hosted on.
autocreate_profile=


; Redirect After Login
; --------------------
; You can login directly to any page in Cypht by going to the correct url before
; logging in, but that is not very user-friendly. To redirect users to a url
; after login, add the url arguments below (everything in the url after, but
; including, the question mark). You must use double quotes around the value
; otherwise it will cause an ini parsing error. To redirect users after login
; to the combined unread view you would use:
;
; redirect_after_login="?page=message_list&list_path=unread"
redirect_after_login=


; Application Name
; ----------------
; This label is used in the UI to reference the program - you can change it to
; "Your awesome webmail" to replace the Cypht name used in various places.
app_name=Cypht


; Force Mobile UI
; ---------------
; Cypht will detect mobile devices and display a mobile optimized UI. If you want
; to aways use this UI regardless of device, set this to true
always_mobile_ui=


; Default Language
; ----------------
; Users can select from available interface languages on the site settings page.
; This sets the default for a user who has not done so. Valid values are 2 character
; langauge codes that have matching language definitions in the language/ folder.
default_language=en


; JavaScript Compression
; ----------------------
; When the configuration script is run, all JavaScript files are concatenated
; and optionally compressed. To compress the content, define a command and its
; options below. Cypht does not come with compresson software, so you must
; install and configure that separately. Leave blank or set to false to disable
; external compression. Compression software must be able to handle ES6.
;
; Example:
;   js_compress='uglifyjs.terser -c -m --verbose --warn'
;
js_compress=false


; CSS Compression
; ---------------
; When the configuration script is run, all CSS files are concatenated and
; optionally compressed. To compress the content, define a command and its
; options below. Cypht does not come with compresson software, so you must
; install and configure that separately. Leave blank or set to false to disable
; external compression.
;
; Example:
;   css_compress='java -jar /usr/local/lib/yuicompressor-2.4.8.jar --type css'
;
css_compress=false


; Caching Server Support
; ---------------------

; Cypht can use Redis or Memcache to improve performance, as well as to store
; user sessions. Configure Redis or Memcached below and Cypht will
; automatically use them for caching. All data cached for a user in either
; system is encrypted. Currently, the feeds, and IMAP modules will use
; the configured cache. If both Redis and Memcached are configured, Redis will
; be used for the cache.
;
; If you want to use the user session as a cache, uncomment the line below and
; set to true. THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED. Cypht uses parallel requests to the
; server, and using the session as a cache is likely to cause race conditions
; and integrity issues. If you are running Cypht in an "embedded" mode with
; only one email source, this option is less likely to be a problem.

; allow_session_cache=false
; cache_class=

; Redis Support
; -------------

; Configure Redis details below to use it for caching
enable_redis=true
redis_server=127.0.0.1
redis_port=6379
redis_index=1
redis_pass=
redis_socket=/var/run/redis/redis-server.sock


; Memcached Support
; -----------------
; Configure Memcached details below to use it for caching
enable_memcached=true
memcached_server=127.0.0.1
memcached_port=11211

; If you need SASL authentication for memcached, set the following to true
; and add the username and password to authenticate with
memcached_auth=false
memcached_user=
memcached_pass=


; Allow Long Sessions
; -------------------
; Cypht logins only last as long as the browser is open. Closing the browser,
; or moving to a new network, will cause you to be logged out. This setting
; provides users with a "stay logged in" option during login that will set the
; sesison lifetime to a default of 30 days, and disable the IP address check.
;
; USE WITH CAUTION SINCE THIS DISABLES SOME SESSION PROTECTIONS.
;
; Specifically:
;
; - Session cookies stay active after a browser restart making them more
;   susceptible to snooping
; - The browser "fingerprint" was use to help protect against session hijacking
;   includes the client's IP. With this option enabled a client IP can change
;   mid-session and it won't log them out
allow_long_session=false

; Set the session lifetime in days. Only applies if allow_long_session is set to
; true, and a user checks the box to "stay logged in" during login.
long_session_lifetime=30


; Browser Encryption Options
; --------------------------
; Cypht can use the Forge JavaScript encryption library to encrypt AJAX
; responses and data stored in browser local storage. Enabling either one of
; these options causes the Forge JavaScript library to be included. This adds
; about 70KB to the page size (when gzipped).

; Use AES encryption for AJAX responses. Set to true to enable, leave blank or
; set to false to disable.
encrypt_ajax_requests=

; Use AES encryption for data stored in the browser local storage. Set to true
; to enable, or leave blank or set to false to disable.
encrypt_local_storage=


; Allow client IP changes
; -----------------------
; By default Cypht will log you out if your client IP address changes. This is
; an extra layer of protection against session hijacking, but it's not uncommon
; for your client IP to change. Change this to true if you want to disable this
; check
disable_ip_check=false


; Allow remote image sources
; --------------------------
;
; WARNING: Using this feature could leak information to external sources.
;
; By default, Cypht will not allow external images to be loaded when viewing an
; HTML formatted email message. A Content Security Policy header limits images
; sources to "self" only and the message content is filtered to remove any external
; resource. If you really want the ability to view external images in an email,
; you first need to change the following setting to true. When viewing an HTML
; formatted message, you will now have a link before the message body called "Allow
; Images" that will reload the message part with external images visible.
allow_external_image_sources=false


;
; Single server mode
; ------------------
; This setting restricts Cypht to only using a single email source (
; IMAP) and the default SMTP server defined in this file. It modifies the UI to
; remove the ability to add other email sources, and removes the password
; restriction when saving data between logins. You must use either IMAP
; authentication for this setting to be enforced, and auth server will be the
; single email source users have access to. If you enable this after users
; have saved any settings, they will be lost (or if you disable it after they
; have saved any settings). WARNING: USER SETTINGS SAVED TO THE SERVER WILL NOT
; BE ENCRYPTED WITH THIS ENABLED
single_server_mode=false


; Integration options
; -------------------
; Cypht does a few things to make it more secure by default, but these features
; can make it difficult to integrate Cypht into 3rd party software. Specifically,
; Cypht disables PHP "super globals", and sets a restrictive PHP "open basedir"
; setting, tweaks PHP ini settings to increase security, and uses a browser
; "fingerprint" to improve session security. You can disable each with the
; following options:

; Don't empty PHP super globals
disable_empty_superglobals=false

; Don't apply open basedir restrictions
disable_open_basedir=false

; Don't tweak ini settings
disable_ini_settings=false

; Don't use a browser fingerprint
disable_fingerprint=false

; You can create your own custom authentication and session classes using the
; site module set, however you might want those classes located somewhere else
; outside of the Cypht code base. By setting session_type and auth_type to custom,
; you can control what class is used with the following settings

; auth_class=
; session_class=


; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
; DB Support
; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

; Database Support
; ----------------
; Cypht can use a database for 3 different purposes: authentication, sessions,
; and user settings. Each requires the following settings to be configured and
; the correct table to be created. CREATE TABLE SQL statements for MySQL and
; Postgresql are below.
;
; Connection type. Can be "host" to connect to a hostname, or "socket" to
; connect to a unix socket.
db_connection_type=host

; Database host name or ip address. If db_connection_type is set to "socket",
; this value is ignored
db_host=127.0.0.1

; Database port. Only needed if your database is running on a non-standard
; port
db_port=

; If db_connection_type is set to "socket", this should be the filesystem
; location of the unix socket file. If db_connection_type is set to "host"
; this value is ignored.
db_socket=/var/lib/mysqld/mysqld.sock

; Name of the database with the required tables
db_name=test

; User to connect to the database with
db_user=test

; Password to connect to the database with
db_pass=123456

; Database type. can be any supported PDO driver ; (http://php.net/manual/en/pdo.drivers.php)
db_driver=mysql


; DB Sessions
; -----------
; If your session_type is set to DB, the following table must exist in the DB
; defined above, and the db user must have read-write access to it:
;
;  Postgresql:
;   CREATE TABLE hm_user_session (hm_id varchar(250) primary key not null, data text, date timestamp);
;
;  MySQL or SQLite:
;   CREATE TABLE hm_user_session (hm_id varchar(180), data longblob, date timestamp, primary key (hm_id));


; DB Authentication
; -----------------
; If your auth_type is set to DB, the following table must exist in the DB
; defined above, and the db user must have read-write access to it:
;
;  Postgresql:
;   CREATE TABLE hm_user (username varchar(255) primary key not null, hash varchar(255));
;
;  MySQL or SQLite:
;   CREATE TABLE hm_user (username varchar(250), hash varchar(250), primary key (username));


; DB Settings
; -----------
; If your user_config_type is set to DB, the following table must exist in the
; DB defined above, and the db user must have read-write access to it:
;
;  Postgresql:
;   CREATE TABLE hm_user_settings (username varchar(250) primary key not null, settings text);
;
;  MySQL or SQLite:
;   CREATE TABLE hm_user_settings(username varchar(250), settings longblob, primary key (username));


; -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
