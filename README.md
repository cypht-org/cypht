#### Cypht

All your E-mail, from all your accounts, in one place. Cypht is not your
father's webmail. Unless you are one of my daughters, in which case it is your
father's webmail. Cypht is like a news reader, but for E-mail. Cypht does not
replace your existing accounts - it combines them into one. And it's also a
news reader.

Unread messages from 9 E-mail accounts in one view

The driving force behind Cypht development is to provide combined views for
multiple accounts, but it's also a standard E-mail client that lets you browse
and manage IMAP folders (or POP3 inboxes), and send outbound messages with
SMTP.

Cypht is an application built entirely of plugins, or as we call them, module
sets (which is obviously way cooler sounding than plugins), that are executed
by the framework. Modules provide a flexible way to add new features or
customize the program without hacking the code.
