    Have a question about security? Found a flaw in Cypht? We want to hear from you! Drop by the #hastymail IRC channel on freenode, or send me an E-mail at jason <span class="e_hl">[at]</span> cypht <span class="e_hl">[dot]</span> org. We take security seriously. Cypht is an entirely volunteer effort, so we can't afford a bounty program. We can however promise that any security issue reported to us before release will receive a quick response, a thorough review, a sincere thanks, and an honorable mention on this page.<br /><br />
<h3 class="top">In the browser</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Forced TLS for browser connections
</li>
<li>
All cookies are session level, HTTP only, and have the secure flag, path, and domain values set
</li>
<li>
HTTP request header fingerprinting and site/user specific page keys
</li>
<li>
Security related HTTP headers like X-XSS-Protection, X-Content-Type-Options, and Content-Security-Policy
</li>
<li>
Configurable idle timeout module set that ends a session after a predetermined amount of time
</li>
<li>
Support for 2 factor authentication with TOTP using the Google Authenticator mobile app
</li>
<li>
Optional AES encrypted AJAX responses (still experimental)
</li>
<li>
Optional AES encrypted local storage cache (still experimental)
</lI>
</ul>
<h3>On the server</h3>
<ul>
<li>
TLS/STARTTLS support for IMAP, POP3, and SMTP connections
</li>
<li>
Oauth2 over IMAP/SMTP supported (currently only Gmail and Outlook support this feature)
</li>
<li>
Session level data is encrypted with a long random string generated on login. Data is stored server side, and the key is stored in a session level secure cookie
</li>
<li>
Persistent data stored between logins is encrypted with a key derived from your clear text password, which is obviously not stored anywhere
</li>
<li>
All encryption is done with AES-256-CBC, encrypt-then-MAC, and PBKDF2 key derivation
</li>
<li>
PHP ini settings are tightened up at runtime for extra security, including open basedir and session best practices (ones writable at runtime)
</li>
<li>
No writable files or directories are used inside the web-server document root, and only 3 files need to be inside the document root to run the program. Module sets may include additional assets, such as the HTML editor for outbound mail
</li>
<li>
Optional local DB based authentication using a salt and PBKDF2
</li>
<li>
HTML formatted E-Mail is filtered through HTMLPurifier with all external resources removed before being rendered
</li>
<li>
    Perfect score from the "Email Privacy Tester" at <a href="https://emailprivacytester.com/">https://emailprivacytester.com/</a>
</ul>
<h3> During development</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Easy output escaping inside modules for potentially dangerous content
</li>
<li>
Development is done with PHP's "E_ALL" and "E_STRICT" error reporting
</li>
<li>
Module design enforces a separation of input processing and output formatting, and encourages concise methods, which makes the code easier to debug and audit
</li>
<li>
Only white-listed and typed/sanitized input is allowed. Modules must pre-define input in order to have access
</li>
<li>
Modules can't reference PHP super-globals, and there are no globally scoped variables at all (there are a few static class instances with private data structures that use getter/setter methods)
</li>
<li>
    <a href="http://cypht.org/docs/test_coverage/index.html">100% unit test coverage with PHPUnit</a> for the application framework
</li>
<li>
    UI tests using Selenium (still very limited) and a generously donated subscription from <a href="http://browserstack.com">browserstack.com</a>
</ul>
